Marooned vehicles and chaos in big cities made headlines. However, the disruption in smaller urban centres has probably been worse. If the infrastructure in big cities is inadequate to deal with the monsoon, emerging urban areas deal with another problem. Infrastructure doesn‚Äôt exist.</p> <p>A highlight of Census 2011 was the surge in urban settlements over the previous decade. The count was 7,933 urban settlements. About 65% of these settlements didn‚Äôt have a master plan, according to a Niti Aayog report in 2021. Moreover, almost half of them continue to be governed as rural entities. It‚Äôs problematic because urban India is not just the primary engine of economic growth, but it‚Äôs where most of the future population growth is expected. GOI estimated that urbanisation contributed to almost 60% of GDP, and almost 75% of the population increase by 2036 will be on account of urban growth.</p> <p>The problem has two dimensions. First, states have undermined the spirit of the 74th constitutional amendment of 1992 that envisaged the transfer of the urban planning function to an elected local government. Second, inadequate devolution of powers has deprived master plans of a sense of reality. They‚Äôre out of sync with the evolution of urban settlements. A common critique is that they are inflexible and overemphasise zoning. The problem here is that master plans, which take a macro view of urban areas, failed to account for the informal nature of urban India‚Äôs employment market. Consequently, zoning plans run into unexpected growth of clusters linked to informal jobs.

As he set his tools and prepared to break in, the scent of fresh flowers overwhelmed his senses, triggering his hay fever.</p> <p>Just then, a feminine voice queried if he had a cold. Startled, Horace found a young, elegantly dressed woman in the doorway. She was calm and poised, suggesting that he see a doctor for his hay fever. As they spoke, it became evident that she was part of the household. Trying to save the situation, Horace subtly threatened her, but the woman remained unflappable. She proposed a deal: in exchange for her silence, Horace would crack the safe for her. She explained she had forgotten the combination but needed her jewels for a party. Seizing the opportunity, Horace agreed.</p> <p>Within an hour, Horace had retrieved the jewels for the woman, believing he had gained an ally and an escape from potential imprisonment. For two days, he refrained from any criminal activity, honoring his commitment. However, the allure of the rare books beckoned, making him contemplate his next theft.</p> <p>To Horace's shock, he was arrested for the robbery at Shotover Grange. His fingerprints, discovered all over the room where he had worked without gloves, betrayed him. He pleaded his case, citing the young woman's request, but faced disbelief. The owner's wife, a stern, elderly woman, denied any involvement, sealing Horace's fate.</p> <p>In prison, Horace assumed the role of assistant librarian. He often found himself ruminating over the charming young imposter who had outsmarted him, realizing that she too was a thief. The age-old saying 'honour among thieves' now irked him, given his bitter experience.</p> <p><strong>Q45.
