This antitrust lawsuit, which began in 2020, after Google removed Epic‚Äôs popular game Fortnite from the Play Store for violating its payment terms, has far-reaching implications for how the Android app ecosystem functions. Epic bypassed Google‚Äôs rules by making users pay the publisher directly, triggering the battle. Judge Donato‚Äôs ruling, set to take effect in November, orders Google to halt practices that have limited competition, such as paying companies to launch apps exclusively on its marketplace or preinstalling Google Play on new devices. It also mandates Google to allow rival app stores to be featured on its Play Store and for app developers to show alternative payment systems. For three years, this injunction will reshape how Google operates its marketplace, creating space for increased competition in the Android ecosystem. But Google argues that these changes pose risks to user privacy and security and could limit developers‚Äô ability to promote their apps.
